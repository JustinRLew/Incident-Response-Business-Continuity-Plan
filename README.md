# Incident Response & Business Continuity Plan (IR-BCP)  

## Overview  
This project provides a **structured Incident Response (IR) and Business Continuity Plan (BCP)** for a fictional company, **XYZ Corp**. The plan ensures that in the event of a **cybersecurity incident**, XYZ Corp can **respond effectively** and **continue business operations** with minimal disruption.  

## Objectives  
- **Develop a clear Incident Response Plan (IRP)** for cybersecurity threats.  
- **Create a Business Continuity Plan (BCP)** to ensure operational resilience.  
- **Assess risks & impact on critical business functions** (Business Impact Analysis - BIA).  
- **Provide a structured response strategy** for containment, eradication, and recovery.  
- **Test and improve plans using real-world simulations**.

## Project Structure  

### 1. Incident Response Plan (IRP)  
The **IRP follows the NIST framework** and includes:  
âœ… **Preparation** â€“ Security policies, team roles, employee training  
âœ… **Detection & Analysis** â€“ Identifying incidents, logs, and threat analysis  
âœ… **Containment & Eradication** â€“ Short & long-term measures to limit impact  
âœ… **Recovery** â€“ Restoring operations & securing systems  
âœ… **Post-Incident Review** â€“ Documenting lessons learned
